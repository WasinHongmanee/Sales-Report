# Restaurant KPIs Visualized

Using data taken from my family restaurant's POS, I created a dashboard in Power BI to help visualize KPIs and explore data. The KPIs we are concerned with are current and past sales and labor costs. We are also looking for ways to optimize employee hours each day.

note: Data has been manipulated to keep trends but not show real values. Second slide which contained employee work hours and food costs have also been taken out.
